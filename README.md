The bot is very simple, users can upload media and chose the uploading category. The media will be then presented to the other users with the possibility to rate them. The user is presented with a private interface
The users can rate like (üëç) or dislike (üëé) this will then give a score to the media.
The user earns reputation depending on the score of its media, and earns also points that can spend to adjust his reputation or buy categories.

The bot has several categories ordered by score (the sum of the score of the media) and they are displayed to the user in pages.
The lower the category score the farther the page will be.
The user will be able to rate pictures only once (a vote is forever).

### The media

* like (üëç): gives one point to the media and gives a point to the user (‚ÇΩ), the uploader gains a point (‚ÇΩ) 
* dislike (üëé): adds a negative point to the media and give one point to the user (‚ÇΩ), the uploader loses a point (‚ÇΩ)
* hide media: the media will not be shown again to the user
* report media: in case that illegal content or material non pertinent to the category gets uploaded
